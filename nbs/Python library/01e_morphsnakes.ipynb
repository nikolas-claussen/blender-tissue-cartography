    "### Morphological Snakes\n",
    "\n",
    "*Morphological Snakes* [1]_ are a family of methods for image segmentation.\n",
    "Their behavior is similar to that of active contours (for example, *Geodesic\n",
    "Active Contours* [2]_ or *Active Contours without Edges* [3]_). However,\n",
    "*Morphological Snakes* use morphological operators (such as dilation or\n",
    "erosion) over a binary array instead of solving PDEs over a floating point\n",
    "array, which is the standard approach for active contours. This makes\n",
    "*Morphological Snakes* faster and numerically more stable than their\n",
    "traditional counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two *Morphological Snakes* methods available in this implementation:\n",
    "*Morphological Geodesic Active Contours* (**MorphGAC**, implemented in the\n",
    "function ``morphological_geodesic_active_contour``) and *Morphological Active\n",
    "Contours without Edges* (**MorphACWE**, implemented in the function\n",
    "``morphological_chan_vese``).\n",
    "\n",
    "**MorphGAC** is suitable for images with visible contours, even when these\n",
    "contours might be noisy, cluttered, or partially unclear. It requires, however,\n",
    "that the image is preprocessed to highlight the contours. This can be done\n",
    "using the function ``inverse_gaussian_gradient``, although the user might want\n",
    "to define their own version. The quality of the **MorphGAC** segmentation\n",
    "depends greatly on this preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, **MorphACWE** works well when the pixel values of the inside\n",
    "and the outside regions of the object to segment have different averages.\n",
    "Unlike **MorphGAC**, **MorphACWE** does not require that the contours of the\n",
    "object are well defined, and it works over the original image without any\n",
    "preceding processing. This makes **MorphACWE** easier to use and tune than\n",
    "**MorphGAC**.\n",
