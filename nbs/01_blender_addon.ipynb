    "\n",

    "### Add-on design\n",
    "\n",
    "The add-on code comprises three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions for carrying out key tissue cartography operations. These are based on the `blender_tissue_cartography` python library, edited to reflect the constraints of python scripting in blender (e.g. the `igl` library is not available).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A class (inherting from `bpy.types.Operator`) defining each add-on button, with an `execute` function defining what happens when you click it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `TissueCartographyPanel(Panel)` class and the `register` function defining all user input fields and how user input fields and buttons from part 2 are laid out in the Tissue Cartography Panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions and classes are documented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow the user to load multiple 3D datasets and meshes into the same blender file, image data is associated with mesh objects. Which data any operation is applied to is determined by the currently selected mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `bpy` library allows the add-on to interact with blender. It is only available within blender's python scripting interface, which is why you cannot run the add-on in a normal python interpreter. See this tutorial for an introduction into scripting Blender: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/scripting/addon_tutorial.html\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to edit/extend the add-on, be aware of the following **hacks** used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Associating data with meshes_: In the add-on, tissue cartography data is associated with blender meshes. For example, loaded volumetric image data (represented as a `numpy` array) is associated with a `BoundingBox` rectangular cuboid showing the volume covered by the image data (see tutorial 3). Unfortunately, blender does not allow adding arbitrary attributes to meshes. The functions `set_numpy_attribute`/`get_numpy_attribute` circumvent this by representing array data as binary buffer + shape. To associate functions with a mesh (e.g. interpolators), a global dictionary is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _UV layout_: To obtain the part of the UV square covered by an unwrapped mesh, a `.png` of the layout is exported to disk and re-read. \n",
    "\n",
    "The add-on makes use of the following libraries which are included with the add-ons using wheels: `numpy, tifffile, scipy, skimage`."
