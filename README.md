## What this tool does

Tissue cartography is a technique for analyzing 3d microscopy data by
taking advantage of the laminar, sheet-like organization of many
biological tissues. Tissue cartography extracts and cartographically
projects surfaces from volumetric image data. This turns your 3d data
into 2d data which is much easier to visualize, analyze, and
computationally process. For more detail, see [Heemskerk & Streichan
2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3648) and [Mitchell & Cislo
2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-02081-w).

`blender_tissue_cartography` is a set of python tools, template analysis
pipelines, and tutorials to do tissue cartography using the popular 3d
creation software [blender](https://www.blender.org/). The goal is to
make tissue cartography as user-friendly as possible using simple,
modular python code and blender’s graphical user interface.

### Work in progress!

This project is a work in progress and I do not recommend installing it
for “production” use yet.

- Tools for individual recordings are in a reasonably complete state.
- Support for multiple recordings (e.g. frames of a movie with a dynamic
  surface or multiple images of similarly-shaped structures) is in
  progress

## Installation

1.  Install required non-python programs: [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)
    (optional), [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/),
    [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/) (optional), and
    [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

2.  Install python via
    [anaconda/miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/),
    if you haven’t already.

    - If `conda` is unbearably slow for you, install
      [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a
      `conda` replacement which is much faster.

3.  [Clone this github
    repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository),
    or simply download the code as a .zip file and unpack it (green
    button “Code”).

4.  Create a `conda` environment with all python dependencies and
    install the `blender_tissue_cartography` module. Open a command
    window in the `blender-tissue-cartography` directory and type:

    - `conda env create -n blender_tissue_cartography -f environment.yml`
    - `conda activate blender_tissue_cartography`
    - `pip install -e .`

5.  (Optional) Install extra python library for `pymeshlab`, required
    for some advanced functionality (remeshing and surface
    reconstruction from within python).

    - `pip install pymeshlab` - Note that this package is not available
      on new ARM Apple computers.

6.  (Optional) If you plan on developing/extending the code, install
    [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)

7.  (Optional) Install the Blender plugin
    [MicroscopyNodes](https://github.com/oanegros/MicroscopyNodes) for
    rendering volumetric `.tif` files in blender

## Usage

To see how things work, it’s best to start with some fully-worked out
examples, which are provided in the `tutorials/` folder. You can look at
the jupyter notebooks on GitHub without downloading anything.

To run a tutorial on your computer, follow the installation instructions
and then [launch
jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) and open
`tutorials/03_basics_example.ipynb`. It is recommended you are
comfortable with running simple python code (you don’t have to do any
coding yourself), and know the basic user interface of blender (again,
nothing fancy).

In general, for each tissue cartography project, first create a folder
to hold your data and results. You run the `blender_tissue_cartography`
pipeline from a jupyter computational notebook, which can also serve as
your lab notebook (notes, comments on the data). Use one of the tutorial
jupyter notebooks as a template with instructions. As you work through
the notebook, you will:

1.  create a segmentation of your 3d data

2.  convert the segmentation into a mesh of your surface of interest

3.  load the mesh into blender to map to unwrap it into the plane

4.  make a cartographic projection of your the 3d data using the
    unwrapped mesh

5.  visualize the results in 3d using blender.

Here’s a screenshot to give you an idea of the work flow for the example
