  segmentation,
- [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/) GUI and python library with
  advanced surface reconstruction tools (required for some workflows).
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) Mesh editing and UV mapping.

### Optional

- Python libraries:
  - [Morphsnakes](https://github.com/pmneila/morphsnakes) “Inflating
    balloon” segmentation
  - [trimesh](https://trimesh.org/) for working with triangular meshes
  - [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) for
    notebook-based development, if you want to add your own code
- Blender plugins:
  - [MicroscopyNodes](https://github.com/oanegros/MicroscopyNodes) for
    rendering volumetric `.tif` files in blender
  - [Uvsquares](https://github.com/Radivarig/UvSquares) For UV maps with
    uniform distortion

## How to use

To start a tissue cartography project, create a folders to hold your
data and results. Copy your `.tif` microscopy data and one of the
template jupyter notebooks into the folders, launch jupyter, and follow
the instructions.

To see how things work, it’s best to start with a fully-worked out
example (see the different `example_` folders).
